# AvalonMiner Controller Dashboard

These are the main packages for the Avalon Controller Dashboard. Whenever you connect your AvalonMiner to your AvalonMiner Controller and access the Dashboard from a web browser, this is the interface you see.

## Development

So looks like there are separate branches for each version of AvalonMiner.

- cgminer-webui-avalon7 for AvalonMiner 7xx.
- cgminer-webui-avalon6 for AvalonMiner 6
- cgminer-webui-avalon4 for Avalon4
